# portfolio
This repository contains the source code for my first attempt at building a portfolio. The portfolio was built using HTML, CSS(specifically Bootstrap 5) and JavaScript. 
It is also designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes. This portfolio can be found [here](https://thahmidur-r.github.io/portfolio/)
